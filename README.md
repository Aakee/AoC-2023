# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges!

## About the challenges

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges.  
You can find the assignments as well as additional information in the [official website](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## About the solutions

The solutions are programmed with Python.  
Depending on the assignment, the solutions might be very sophisticated and well documented, or just some quick and dirty bruteforcing. While they do give the correct solution for the given problems, they shouldn't be used as case-examples when learning to program or to solve puzzles ;\) I do these for fun. If you have questions or comments, though, don't hesitate to send me a message!

## How to run

Each script works as they are, without external modules (other than the standard library).  
To run a script, execute command  
    `[path-to-python-intepreter] [path-to-this-script] [path-to-input-text-file]`   
For example,  
    `python ./aoc2023-day01 ./inputs/day01.txt`  

The input file path can alternatively be given hard-coded to the script itself. If command line argument is given, it will take precedence.
